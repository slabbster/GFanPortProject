For your convenience Gfan has been precompiled with gmp and cddlib for selected systems.
<br>
<br>
Gmp and cddlib are licensed under the GNU LGPL and GNU GPL respectively.

The precompiled executables make the installation process easy:
<ul>
<li> Download the executable file for your system to the directory where you want Gfan to be.
</li>
<li>
Change the name of the executable file to gfan.
</li>
<li>
Open a terminal/shell and go to the directory to where you put the gfan executable file.
</li>
<li>
Make sure that the executable file is executable by doing
<code>chmod 755 gfan </code>
in your shell.
</li>
<li>
Run <code>./gfan installlinks</code> to create symbolic links.
</li>
<li>
For convenience set up your path by adding the line<br>
<code>set PATH=$PATH:/Users/yourusername/thedirectoryname</code><br>
to either the file <code>.profile</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code> depending on your system.<br> Both files are located in your home directory. You should change the above line,<br> so that it points to the directory where you put the executable file.
</li>
</ul>

Thanks to the people who supplied us with binaries!
